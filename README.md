# cryptography_Varamasami
It is to Crypt and decrypt a text message or text document.

## Getting Started

When a document is added in the toCrypt folder, a service will automatically crypt the document and send it to the crypted folder.
And a crypted document is added in the toDecypt folder, another service will automatically decrypt the document and send it to the decryoted folder.

### Prerequisites

Clone the git repository on your computer: git clone https://github.com/vennila0720/cryptography_Varamasami.git


### Installing

You just need to execute the file install.sh into your terminal and the job is done with the code : ./install.sh

note:*You need to give the file executable rights for it to be able to install on your pc, the code to fix that is :chmod +x install.sh*

The code will copy itself into your home ~/src to avoid conflits and issues.
